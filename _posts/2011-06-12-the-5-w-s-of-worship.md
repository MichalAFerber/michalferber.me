[John 4:7-26](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.4.ESV)   
   
*The who, what, where, when, and why of worship.*   
   
Psalms is full of worship; I believe David had a true heart of worship. The biggest book in the bible is David’s songs and prayers; where he is crying out to God; sometimes victorious other times defeated by his sin and others thankful for God’s abundant grace and mercy.   
   
But true worship; true anything requires and understanding. Worship isn’t about simply singing a song, or worshiping in tithes and offerings. Instead it is a conscious act and commitment in our heart to purposefully honor God and give him the glory for what he is doing and has done.   
   
Have you noticed that humans have an innate desire to worship? If a person is not worshiping a deity, they might worship music artists, political figures, family, money, or numerous other things.   
   
Why did God give us this desire? God designed us like this so we would worship Him and only Him. Other items fail us, die, or rot. God is a constant; He will never fail us, He is always faithful.   
   
**Who should we worship?**   
   
[Revelations 4:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.4.ESV)   
You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created.   
   
*We are to worship the one who created us.*   
   
The One who was and is and is to come.   
The Alpha and the Omega.   
God almighty.   
The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.   
   
[John 4:7-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.4.ESV)   
*Jesus answers the question of Who.*   
   
**What is worship?**   
   
[Romans 12:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.12.ESV)    
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.   
   
*Worship isn’t about us. Worship is about Him.*   
   
Jesus set up the system of worship, so when we decide to enter into worship, we are no longer in control of ourselves, but we are entering His turf and submitting ourselves to the will of God. This is where humility kicks in.   
   
Humility is the first key to any successful time of worship. Throughout the entire bible the primary Hebrew and Greek words for worship mean humility. Without humility you cannot truly worship. Humility means to lower yourself and submit yourself to the will of another. So when you worship, you are coming under submission of the Holy Spirit, and allowing Him to act, walk, and speak in and through you.   
   
[John 4:11-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.4.ESV)   
*Jesus gives the requirement of Humility.*   
   
How can we humble ourselves if we still have sin in our life?   
How can we even ask God to entertain us with his presence when we aren’t willing to repent?   
How can we ask our Father to be real with us, if we won’t be real with Him?   
How can we worship Him, if we don’t know him.   
Where and When do we worship?   
   
[Psalm 1:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.1.ESV)   
Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night.   
   
We are to worship God continually, not just on Sunday mornings, not just when we sing songs of praise and worship. We are to worship Him in all that we do.   
   
[John 4:19-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.4.ESV)   
*Jesus answers the question of Where and When.*   
   
**Why do we worship?**   
   
[Revelations 5:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.5.ESV)   
Saying with a loud voice: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honor and glory and blessing!”    
   
*We worship God because he is worthy.*   
   
[John 4:25-26](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.4.ESV)   
*Jesus answers the question of Why.*   
   
Worship is a conscious act and commitment in our heart to purposefully honor God and give him the glory for what he is doing and has done.   
   
Worship requires humility and to be real with God. It’s not about us; it’s about Him for He is worthy.
