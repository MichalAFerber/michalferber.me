A new feature in the Mosyle MDM is the ability to allow users to have admin permission only when they need it. In the past, you had to use a static password that the user knew or rotate the password and then give the password when the user asks for it.

To turn on the Admin On-Demand functionality, go to Security -> Admin On-Demand -> Settings. Add a new profile with the setting selections and assignments you prefer. Thatâ€™s it.

To activate, the user navigates to the Mosyle Self-Service app, clicks on Admin On-Demand, and makes the request.
